<h1>Song Genre Classification Project</h1>
<h3>Project Overview</h3>
<p>Welcome to the Song Genre Classification project! This repository hosts the <code>Project.ipynb</code> Jupyter notebook, detailing an end-to-end machine learning project to classify songs into genres, focusing on distinguishing between Rock and Hip-Hop tracks using various musical features.</p>

<h3>Dataset</h3>
<p>The analysis utilizes the <code>fma-rock-vs-hiphop.csv</code> dataset, which includes a variety of musical attributes from the <a href="https://freemusicarchive.org/">Free Music Archive</a>. Each track is characterized by features such as tempo, energy, danceability, and more.</p>

<h3>Features</h3>
<h4>Key steps and features of this project include:</h4>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Data Preprocessing</strong>: Filtering the dataset, handling missing values, and preparing data for analysis.</li>
  <li><strong>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)</strong>: Investigating the dataset to uncover genre-defining patterns and characteristics.</li>
  <li><strong>Feature Selection</strong>: Choosing the most relevant features for genre classification.</li>
  <li><strong>Model Training and Evaluation</strong>: Building and fine-tuning machine learning models to classify song genres and evaluating their performance.</li>
  <li><strong>Validation</strong>: Applying cross-validation strategies to ensure the model's robustness across different data subsets.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Technologies Used</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Python 3</strong>: The primary programming language for algorithm implementation and data processing.</li>
  <li><strong>Jupyter Notebook</strong>: For interactive development and documenting the code.</li>
  <li><strong>Pandas</strong>: For data manipulation and analysis.</li>
  <li><strong>NumPy</strong>: For high-performance numerical computing.</li>
  <li><strong>Scikit-learn</strong>: For accessible and versatile machine learning tools.</li>
  <li><strong>Matplotlib/Seaborn</strong>: For creating informative and attractive statistical graphics.</li>
</ul>
